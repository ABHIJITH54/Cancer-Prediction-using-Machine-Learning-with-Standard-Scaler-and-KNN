# Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Standard-Scaler-and-KNN
This project focuses on cancer prediction using a Machine Learning model, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed using the Standard Scaler to normalize the features, improving model performance and accuracy.
